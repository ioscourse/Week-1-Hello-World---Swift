/**Variables:

Variables CANNOT start with a number

When declaring variables use var [prefix: variable type; str, dbl,
fl,bl,int][name of variable] = [value with quotes of string, without quotes if numeric]

//example of implicit type

var strPlaceOfBirth = "Middletown, NY"

//example of explicit type

var strYearsOld:Int = 45

//example of constant variable

let intAge = 47

//error if try to reassign constant

//intAge = 48

//example of variable that can be changed

var intMyAge = 47

intMyAge = 46


//showing variables format: \(variablename)

//example of putting variables togther

var strMyAge = "I was born in \(strPlaceOfBirth) and my age is \(strYearsOld)"

//make newline use \n

//example:

//new line
var nl = "\n"

//example with newline

println( "I was born in \(strPlaceOfBirth) \(nl) and my age is \(strYearsOld) \(nl)")

//println prints line without newline
         
println("I was born in \(strPlaceOfBirth) and my age is \(strYearsOld)")



//Exercise

//declare string variable for your firstname



//declare string variable for your lastname



//declare string varibale for phone number



//declare string variable for your email
